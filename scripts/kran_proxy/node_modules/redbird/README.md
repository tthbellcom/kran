Redbird Reverse Proxy
=====================

![redbird](http://logo32.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/red-bird-Vector.jpg)

Handling dynamic virtual hosts, load balancing, proxying web sockets and SSL encryption should be
easy and robust.

With redbird you get a complete library to build dynamic reverse proxies with the speed and robustness of http-proxy.

This light-weight package includes everything you need for easy reverse routing of your applications.
Great for routing many applications from different domains in one single host, handling SSL with ease, etc.

##Install


```
npm install redbird
```

##Example


You can programatically register or unregister routes dynamically even if the proxy is already running:

```
var proxy = require('redbird')({port: 80});

// Route to any global ip
proxy.register("optimalbits.com", "http://167.23.42.67:8000");

// Route to any local ip, for example from docker containers.
proxy.register("example.com", "http://172.17.42.1:8001");

// Route from hostnames as well as paths
proxy.register("example.com/static", "http://172.17.42.1:8002");
proxy.register("example.com/media", "http://172.17.42.1:8003");

// Subdomains, paths, everything just works as expected
proxy.register("abc.example.com", "http://172.17.42.4:8080");
proxy.register("abc.example.com/media", "http://172.17.42.5:8080");

// Route to any href including a target path
proxy.register("foobar.example.com", "http://172.17.42.6:8080/foobar");

```


##About HTTPS

The HTTPS proxy supports virtual hosts by using SNI (which most modern browsers support: IE7 and above).
The proxying is performed by hostname, so you must use the same SSL certificates for a given hostname independently of its paths.


##HTTPS Example

Conceptually HTTPS is easy, but it is also easy to struggle getting it right. With redbird its straightforward, check this complete example:

1) Generate a localhost development SSL certificate:

```
/certs $ openssl genrsa -out dev-key.pem 1024
/certs $ openssl req -new -key dev-key.pem -out dev-csr.pem

// IMPORTANT: Do not forget to fill the field! Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:localhost

/certs $ openssl x509 -req -in dev-csr.pem -signkey dev-key.pem -out dev-cert.pem

```

Note: For production sites you need to buy valid SSL certificates from a trusted authority.

2) Create a simple redbird based proxy:

```
var redbird = new require('redbird')({
	port: 8080,

	// Specify filenames to default SSL certificates (in case SNI is not supported by the 
	// user's browser)
	ssl: {
		port: 8443,
		key: "certs/dev-key.pem",
		cert: "certs/dev-cert.pem",
	}
});

// Since we will only have one https host, we dont need to specify additional certificates.
redbird.register('localhost', 'http://localhost:8082', {ssl: true});
```

3) Test it:

Point your browser to ```localhost:8000``` and you will see how it automatically redirects to your https server and proxies you to 
your target server.


You can define many virtual hosts, each with its own SSL certificate. And if you do not define any, they will use the default one
as in the example above:

```
redbird.register('example.com', 'http://172.60.80.2:8082', {
	ssl: {
		key: "../certs/example.key",
		cert: "../certs/example.crt",	
		ca: "../certs/example.ca"
	}
});

redbird.register('foobar.com', 'http://172.60.80.3:8082', {
	ssl: {
		key: "../certs/foobar.key",
		cert: "../certs/foobar.crt",	
	}
});

```


##Features

- Flexible and easy routing.
- Websockets.
- Seamless SSL Support (HTTPS -> HTTP proxy)
- Automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirects.
- Register and unregister routes programatically.
- Optional logging based on bunyan.

##Roadmap

- Load balancer.
- Simple IP Filtering.
- Automatic routing via Redis or Etcd backend.

<a name="redbird"/>
###Redbird(opts)

This is the Proxy constructor. Creates a new Proxy and starts listening to
the given port.

__Arguments__

```javascript
    opts {Object} Options to pass to the proxy:
    {
    	port: {Number} // port number that the proxy will listen to.
    	ssl: { // Optional SSL proxying.
    		port: {Number} // SSL port the proxy will listen to.
    		// Default certificates
    		key: keyPath,  
    		cert: certPath,
    		ca: caPath // Optional.
    	}
	}
```

---------------------------------------

<a name="register"/>
#### Redbird##register(src, target, opts)

Register a new route. As soon as this method is called, the proxy will
start routing the sources to the given targets.
  
__Arguments__

```javascript
    src {String} {String|URL} A string or a url parsed by node url module.
    	Note that port is ignored, since the proxy just listens to one port.

    target {String|URL} A string or a url parsed by node url module.
    opts {Object} route options:
    examples:
    {ssl : true} // Will use default ssl certificates.
    {ssl: {
        redirectPort: port, // optional https port number to be redirected if entering using http.
    	key: keyPath,
    	cert: certPath,
    	ca: caPath // optional
    	}
    }
```

---------------------------------------

<a name="unregister"/>
#### Redbird##unregister(src)

 Unregisters a route. After calling this method, the given route will not
 be proxied anymore.
  
__Arguments__

```javascript
    src {String} {String|URL} A string or a url parsed by node url module.
```

---------------------------------------

<a name="close"/>
#### Redbird##close()

 Close the proxy stoping all the incoming connections.
